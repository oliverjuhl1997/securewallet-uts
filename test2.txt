srcmp() compares the two strings lexicographically means it starts comparison character by character starting from the first character until the characters in both strings are equal or a NULL character is encountered.
If first character in both strings are equal, then this function will check the second character, if this is also equal then it will check the third and so on
This process will be continued until a character in either string is NULL or the characters are unequal.
